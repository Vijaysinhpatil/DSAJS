# 🔁 **Palindrome Number Checker**

This folder contains the implementation of the **Palindrome Number** problem from the **_Arrays → Easy_** section of the `DSAJS` repository.  
It demonstrates how to reverse a number mathematically and verify whether it reads the same forward and backward.

## 🧩 **Problem Statement**

> Given an integer `n`, check whether it is a **palindrome number**.  
>  
> A number is called a palindrome if it remains the same when its digits are reversed.  
>  
> **Example:**
> ```
> Input: n = 121
> Output: "121 number is Palindrome"
> ```
> **Explanation:**  
> The reverse of 121 is also 121 → ✅ hence it’s a palindrome.  
>  
> **Another Example:**  
> ```
> Input: n = -121
> Output: "number is not a palindrome"
> ```
> Negative numbers are **not** palindromes because the minus sign breaks symmetry.
